To avoid becoming average, thus, I started investing to earn wealth and do something meaningful with the purpose I give life. I plan to work at a Hedge fund, run for presidency in Peru, grow Quinoa, and own a university. Unlike most, I like to quantify data because it eliminates the subjectivity that contains moral superiority complexes or the use of perceived injustices that hinder true development.",
